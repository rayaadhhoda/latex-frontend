\section{Introduction}

The Tundra refers to a cold region. Cold regions remind us of the Ice Age. There are many incredibly written and animated characters in the Ice Age, like the big mammoth, the sloth, and the squirrel. For many, it is their first experience in parallel storylines as a form of storytelling. As such, it can be difficult to follow along, but when presented as elegantly as it is, it forms an environment conducive to learning.
